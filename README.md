How it works?
===========
It works based on english sentence structure. It finds the second word of a sentence and check if it is a verb or not if not then it finds the first word and based on the first word it determine where the subject is located. Based on the subject it determines what is the topic of the sentence.
There are some base structures given and if it finds some new sentence pattern then it will add that new pattern to the system. This is how it will be more educated gradually. Based on its experience it will determine which is the topic of this sentence.
